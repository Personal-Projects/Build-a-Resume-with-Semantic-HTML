# Build-a-Resume-with-Semantic-HTML

Challenge: To create a web page for a fictional character's resume, focusing on using semantic HTML. Use a fictional character and not yourself so you don't get bogged down in perfecting the information in the resume.

## Requirements
* Use semantic HTML throughout the page. At a minimum you should use: <header>, <main>, <section>, and <address>.
* Include a page title (aka, use a <title> element) and meta description in the head. You should include these in all public facing web pages you create because they help web crawlers understand your page and contribute to search engine optimization.
* There should be a contact info section, with the following information about your character:
  * Name
  * Email address (make one up) as a link
  * Phone number (make one up)
  * A picture (feel free to choose one) as a stand-in for your character.
* There should be a section for your character's education, and it should list at least one college she attended.
* There should be a section for your character's employment history, and it should contain at least two entries. Each entry should show the company name, job title, dates of employment, and a short description of the job (for this last bit, feel free to use lorem ipsum filler text).
